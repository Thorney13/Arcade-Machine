Development Log

 Start Date - 17th October 2019
   
    Update(17/10/2019): 
 
    Today I have started my Digital Arts Computing project and have set it up on GitHub. I created the basic project outline and 
    divded the project into two sections, Construction and Game Development. This will help allow me to know how far through the 
    project I am. I will post updates when I have completed sections of the project and place ticks in their respected positions.
